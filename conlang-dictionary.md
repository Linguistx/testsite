# example entry

New word entries start with a single pound sign #. Sub-headings are created with ## and sub-sub-headings with ###.

There is no "correct" way to structure your dictionary entries, but one option to place the pronunciation at the top of the entry, and use sub-sub-headings for the parts-of-speech. Eg:

/pronunciaiton of the word/

2. second translation
